To run the simulator first setup the environmet using the command below:
```
1. source setup_environment release
2. make
```
Now you should run the benchmark. I have put the Matrix matrix multplication benchmark in the main directory so just run this:
```
4. ./mal
```
The changes I have made are inside ```gpu-sim.cc``` and ```gpu-sim.h``` and ```shader.cc``` files.
