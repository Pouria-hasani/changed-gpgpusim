To run the simulator first setup the environmet using the command below:
```
1. source setup_environment release
2. make
```
Now you should run the benchmark. I have put the Matrix matrix multplication benchmark in the main directory so just run this:
```
3. ./mall
```
I have changed  ```/src/gpgpusim/gpu-sim.cc``` and ```/src/gpgpusim/gpu-sim.h``` and ```/src/gpgpusim/shader.cc``` files.
